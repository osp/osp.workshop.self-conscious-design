			<p>Talking about escape is nothing new. In the mid 1960s, to pick one rather famous example, The Animals’ song ‘We Gotta Get out of This Place’ found resonance with a large mainstream audience. In fact, themes of escape are quite common in popular culture. The repertoire of Johnny Cash suggests itself as a case in point. Sometimes the points of escape are literal and material, such as in classic prison escape movies, in other instances they may be about social pressures and oppressive social norms, like in <em>The Graduate</em> (1967), <em>Vanishing Point</em> (1971), or <em>Thelma and Louise</em> (1991). The list continues, and in so doing suggests that talk about escape, rather than escape itself, has been a relatively prominent cultural presence for some time. But, we might ask, what form do such representations of escape take in an increasingly connected and networked social context, where social media have come to be so integral to everyday life?</p>
			<p>Over the last few years there have been lots of claims made about the power of social media. For some these media are disruptive of genuine social ties, for others these are a new source of social solidarity and connectivity. Social media are quite polarizing in this regard. It would seem to us though that one of the most prominent outcomes of the integration of social media into everyday life is the new type of social visibility that it creates. They make it possible to see into various aspects of peoples’ ordinary and extraordinary experiences. From the very early stages of what was once called Web 2.0 much has been said about the intervention of social media in the relations between the private and the public. These questions were driven by the many applications based on the need to place parts of our private lives in the public domain.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-1-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-1">1</a></sup> This is clearly important, but what we would like to do here is to sidestep some of these well-established debates and instead use the visibility of everyday interactions generated by social media. This visibility, we suggest, along with others, has created some important opportunities for doing very different types of social research. </p>

			<p>Social media data listeners or aggregators are software devices that capture social media content that refers to specified search terms. They allow content created by social media participation to be harvested as a kind of by-product data that in turn can be used for social research.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-2-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-2">2</a></sup> In this instance the software aggregator was created by a company called Insighlytics<sup><a id="footnote-302270-3-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-3">3</a></sup> and was used to search the terms ‘escape’ and ‘escaping’. According to the software developers this device covers,</p>
			<p class="quote">a wide range of social and other online media sources. It includes blogs (including Blogger, Wordpress, Typad, and LiveJournal), microblogging sites (Twitter), social networks (public Facebook pages), video sharing sites (YouTube), discussion boards, review sites and online news sources (regional, national and international).<sup><a id="footnote-302270-4-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-4">4</a></sup></p>
			<p>The data we accumulated for this work took place between the 20th of July 2011 and August 26th of the same year – we might of course imagine that the time of year in which we conducted the study might have shaped the content, the outdoor hazy days of summer and the like. The ‘buzz graph’ generated by the software reports a consistently high level of talk about escape. Most of the days covered included somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 posts mentioning ‘escape’ or ‘escaping’. Even over this one-month period we have accumulated over 50,000 instances. As well as these quantifying measures, the software also allows us to see the words that are most commonly associated with escape and escaping within this content. Figure 1 shows a word map containing the words commonly associated with escape or escaping. The word map also shows linkages between these words where they have been used in association with one another in content about escape.</p>
			<p>The word map reveals some common themes within these frequently associated words, which we can begin to map out. The temporality of escape is apparent here with reference to time, long, and years. Emotional type responses also seem to be developed with words like happy, hard, great, give and feel. There is also the sense of a material territory of escape with the use of terms like house, world, America, full, people, read and possibly high. These visualizations are useful in giving us a general sense of the talk of escape, but they give little sense of the context and detail of this talk. It is to this detail that we now move. </p>
			<h3 class="text_subtitle">Talking About Escape on a Small Scale</h3>
			<p>By selecting these common terms it is possible to see that escape is a part of everyday mundane discourse in social media. The volume of content would suggest that the discussion of escape is in itself socially important and takes advantage of what Zappavigna has called ‘[…] a cultural shift in electronic discourse from online conversation to such “searchable talk”’.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-5-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-5">5</a></sup> Embedded as part of this searchable talk, escape is a common topic used in ways that express dissatisfaction, resistance, and transience. It often positions the creator of the utterance as either wishing to escape or is used to express concern about the inescapability of specific and non-specific life factors. Indeed, after the rise of the network society, there has been a push for the organization of modern life to be more connected rather than less connected. Writing about a culture of speed, Tomlinson has noted that ‘[a]cceleration rather than deceleration has been the constant leitmotiv of cultural modernity’.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-6-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-6">6</a></sup> A reading of Tomlinson offers rich description and reflection on what he describes as the fast pace of modern life. There is, he argues, a decisive move to a cultural imagining of a world organized by genuine and significant shifts in temporality, and this reflects the desire to slip away or to get away from daily life as indicated by the exploration of social media content discussed in the following extracts. We see this connectivity of everyday life coming together with the need to find space within an accelerated and inescapable flow of culture.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-7-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-7">7</a></sup> In short, the act of escape itself is important, but so are the ways in which the practice of or desire to escape are frequently discussed. The desire to remove oneself, or to present the image of a desire to remove oneself from constraining norms, places, and people are prominent in the content. It is possible to read a sense of solidarity into this talk of escape. The term comes to define an activity or a hope that is communicated as a culmination of frustration and annoyance at the oppressive aspects of work, environmental conditions, leisure, and family life. These are frequently expressed through social media. Talking about escape is as much about talking of immobility and inescapability as it is about mobility and cutting free. In the following brief analysis we organize the content by returning to the three overarching themes founds in the word map: temporality, emotionality, and territoriality. In order to identify particular utterances within these themes we simply selected some of the key words from the word map that relate to these three themes to generate a list of postings containing those words.</p>
			<h3 class="text_subtitle">Talking About the Temporality of Escape</h3>
			<p>Escape in the context of everyday life is a phenomenon that has strong social aspects, even before the proliferation of social media. It is not surprising then that our first theme refers to the broader sense of movement around escape and the increased pressure upon personal time that is threatened by the expansion of the ‘social factory’.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-8-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-8">8</a></sup> We begin then with content that has a temporal dimension and that in some way refers to the intermittence of escape and its possible temporal limits and boundaries. As Cohen and Taylor note, ‘interruptions or breaks from paramount reality don’t last long’.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-9-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-9">9</a></sup></p>
			<p>Our first extract displays an off-the-cuff and personal reflection:</p>
			<p class="quote">oh, hahaha. in that case, i’ll be escaping that for the next 4 years. it goes both ways</p>
			<p>Escaping in this context conveys the intention of a movement away from, and protection of, the self against what may arise in the anticipated ‘next 4 years’. One might derive that the concept of escape points towards the opportunity to be focused on the safeguarding of personal space and the protection of personal time. In a similar tone the following update treats escape as part of a temporal discourse, implying both interest in the personal investment of time and a hidden agenda related to an implied change to everyday life.</p>
			<p class="quote">You might get another 30 years out of them, with gentle treatment. Do you have an escape plan?</p>
			<p>Both of these extracts are loose in terms of specific context in that neither name particular individuals, places or times. The connection to escape is represented by their temporal movement that is measured in years, and provides the most common and intuitive understanding of each setting. When the above posts refer to years, this reference is in terms of a broader sense of time and opportunity to escape from what can be inferred as the daily ‘grind’ of life.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-10-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-10">10</a></sup> The experience of escape is at once a personal decision and action. Escaping here is a response that hints at the need to be able to ‘manipulate’ the ‘arrangements’.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-11-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-11">11</a></sup> </p>
			<p>This need to escape from some form of discomfort becomes a reflection of the hours of work that constitute this daily grind:</p>
			<p class="quote">Being able to escape the competitiveness, the backstabbing and the long hours of the rat race</p>
			<p>The ‘rat race’ reference hints toward affect and the particular circumstances created by precarious forms of labor.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-12-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-12">12</a></sup> Escape occupies different aspects of a temporal spectrum at the same time, as part of a vocational setting and the relationships with others in that setting. Escape offers the authors of the above posts a sense of freedom or being able to get away from it all. Frequently these appear intertwined with various stresses from external demands and pressures.</p>
			<p>These pressures are often time-based. For example, the following three extracts show how a sense of escape in various modes is tied to a particular and individual sense of time:</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">by the time im 18 im escaping !!!!</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">It’s time to escape.. If only it was that easy.</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">those long long days with no escaping</p>
			<p>Escape is fixed in place by a sense of the external regulation of time and age, of the boundaries of the lifecycle. Here the focus is on the association of the sense of imprisonment and despondency with the improbable aspiration escape can afford. Writing about a liquid modernity, Bauman suggests ‘[…] one’s capacity to escape, to disengage, [is] to “be elsewhere”, and the right to decide the speed with which all that is done’.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-13-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-13">13</a></sup> Reading the extracts, the contemporary take is expressed around a narrative of escape that is out of reach both in its formation as much as it is in its expression to others. These three posts present an active discourse that captures a desire to escape, to subvert the context of the present as ‘[…] those long days’. This discourse treats escape as a sense of lived time formed through a narrative of self-reflection and aspirational future desire. The social condition of escape is revealed to us as an audience amongst an implicit formation of wider narratives about the self and imagined explanations that might involve an ‘escape plan’, from the ‘rat race’, ‘if only it was that easy’. To consolidate these six extracts there is an expression of escape that is at once without progress and at the same time has hope for a transformation that never comes about. Escape is desired as a moment of departure that is signaled as a separation from the confinement of everyday practices and representations. These escape plans are defined by temporal limitations and boundaries that prevent or enable escape only for a limited timescale. We have introduced only a small number of utterances here, but found that this foregrounding of issues of timing is highly prominent when talking about escape and escape plans, with the prominence of temporality underpinning the remaining themes that we will now discuss.</p>
			<h3 class="text_subtitle">Talking About the Emotionality of Escape</h3>
			<p>The distinctive quality of the nature of escape may be presented as a kind of vulnerability in everyday life, one that is related to individual lived experience, senses of connectedness, or a reaction to a prevailing sense of compulsion and self-reflection. This is true both in the context of our second theme and the significance of these mentions communicated via social media. The scrutiny of the self reveals an apparent tension between an increasing dissatisfaction with the immediacy of the everyday and the drive towards the abolition of reality:</p>
			<p class="quote">I feel like escaping from reality )):</p>
			<p>Escape is channeled as a transformative dimension to produce new delights and experiences. The agenda for such reflective analysis is an emotional and personal one as the two following disclosures make known: </p>
			<p class="quote">No matter how much I intoxicate myself, there’s no escaping the fact that I’m just not happy. </p>
			<p class="quote">Life Skills Master Class Lesson #365: If you dream of escaping everyday, you are not happy.</p>
			<p>The metaphor of dreaming is suggestive of the unobtainable nature of escape. This is a reference to escape in terms of a reflection on happiness and the experience of everyday life. There is an emotive quality to these notifications. Due to the nature of the update they provide a different texture to declarations of escape, where there is an assumed connectedness to others and, perhaps, a painfully felt proximity to the self that is presented by the repeated reference of ‘I’ and ‘you’. One reading of the motivation to update is that the notifications present a way of handing over one’s thoughts to others in an informal, conversational and easy manner.</p>
			<p>The influential work of George Herbert Mead<sup><a id="footnote-302270-14-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-14">14</a></sup> whose formative theory of the self as a fusion of the singular ‘I’ with the pluralized ‘Me’ reflects this very motivation for interaction, by encompassing the social attitudes of others that act as a mirror for individual identity and sense of social self. It is this need to be seen to enter into dialogue with others, with the intention to receive favorable comment or engagement, that reflects an eagerness for escape. It is possible that we are looking here at what Mary Holmes has referred to as the ‘emotionalization of reflexivity’, the way that emotions are core to reflexive processes of fitting-in in changing social circumstances. Holmes claims that:</p>
			<p class="quote">To recognize reflexivity as emotionalized is to see that interpreting one’s and other’s emotions is increasingly necessary. Being good at emotion work does not automatically bring social success, because emotional reflexivity is not simply a matter of individuals exercising skills. Emotions are done in interaction with others; they involve bodies, thought, talk and action. Feelings make embodied social selves and selves and lives are made within the social constraints of place and time [...] Further work is required [...] to make sense of how and why some people are better able to feel their way in a rapidly changing world.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-15-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-15">15</a></sup></p>
			<p>Holmes suggests that the centrality of emotions in the reflexive process is central to everyday life and needs to be understood in order to reveal these processes and to see how social and cultural change, including the rise of social media, become embodied in everyday interactions, friendships and emotional responses.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-16-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-16">16</a></sup> In this context, escape connects first to ideas that are built on the aspiration for happiness that is influenced by the constant awareness and gaze of others, as well the dissatisfaction with the here and now. The communication of escape becomes part of the reflexive processes of emotionality pointed at by Holmes, the visibility of emotional conduct in social media magnifies and challenges established emotional propriety and etiquette. This association is presented in the following updates:</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">I should be happy I’m going on holiday but I feel like I’m escaping the problems here </p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">let me escape from this world. </p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Don’t you just feel like just escaping sometimes?</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Yall dont ever feel like escaping your BODY?</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">i need a great escape</p>
			<p>For the authors of these updates, escape cannot in any easy way be contained or achieved. This reveals the relative value attached to escape and the boundaries that confine the individual or regulate what are perceived as free and unfree spaces. There is a physical dimension of the reactions against the pressures of ‘the world’. The regulation of the physicality of the body and boundaries of escaping is made plain by the question ‘Yall don’t ever feel like escaping your BODY?’ The first post engages with the implications of the moment of escaping by reflecting ‘[...] I feel like I’m escaping the problems here’. Published and seen through the funnel of social media such personal thoughts have become part of daily grumbles. These seem mundane but the prominence in the content forces us to reflect upon their social value. By activating such updates individuals selectively externalize a ‘letting go’ of emotive outcry and reflection. </p>
			<p>What is interesting about the classification of these updates is how they pose a constrained version of escape. The following two updates hint at authors’ expectations and anticipations of escape:</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">I feel like escaping. I think I’m about to do that soon</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">I feel like my soul is slowly escaping front the capsule as this lecture goes by</p>
			<p>Despite our roles as academics and lecturers, it is hard not to feel sympathy for the creator of the second post (hopefully not one of our students) who attaches an impassive control over their potential to escape from the confines of a lecture – whilst also inferring their position as a bored and distanced participant in the education process. Despite the fact that they are yet to achieve escape, they share an optimistic perspective. While both may be entrapped, these are temporary states and escape forms an important part of the narrative of the snapshot into their situations. The expected consequences of escape keep a reign on both individuals’ present state and may be related to some of the chief characteristics of the escaping process. Drawing all these extracts together there is some suggestion of continued states of uncertainty. This is the type of social uncertainty that Holmes has noted is a consequence of changing social, technological and cultural boundaries and practices.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-17-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-17">17</a></sup> The first being a heightened anxiousness that must be escaped from and the second a reaction to the tedious and mundane that can be criticized and explained openly via social media updates. Up to this point, time and emotive reflection have both been constraining factors in these accounts, for our final theme we turn to the sources of confinement and the potential destinations of escape.</p>
			<h3 class="text_subtitle">Talking About the Territoriality of Escape</h3>
			<p>The key characteristic of escape talk appears to be associated with how escaping is intrinsically unobtainable, uncertain, and always personal. Given the nature of how the data was extracted through social media, this level of personalization may not be entirely unexpected. It is in these interactions that we get a sense of how material territories are produced and elaborated. And so, in one way, some of the unobtainable dimensions of escape are (albeit temporarily) overcome – at least to the extent that a shared notification links an individual to others and can be retrieved and read by an external audience. One repeated reference was to the home or place of residence:</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Escaping the madness at my house for a few minutes</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">leaves the house escaping the chaos</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">heading up to garbo as a means of escaping the house </p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Can’t wait to get out of this house </p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Planning an escape route out of my house</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Getting ready to clean this house up a bit and then escaping to some ac for the day</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Another day of madness and a house full of builders! Looking forward to escaping for lunch with the oldies</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">I’m seriously thinking of escaping my house right now. My brain is going to explode</p>
			<p>Here the features of the home provide a point from which to escape. This depicts the inverse of Lasch’s description of home as a ‘haven in a heartless world’<sup><a id="footnote-302270-18-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-18">18</a></sup> in favor of a discourse where a haven is sought in the largely anonymous audience of Twitter followers and Facebook friends and where the domestic territory becomes the thing to be escaped from. As well as the reference to ‘the house’, these suggest a range of other social concerns that make up the common rhetoric of escape. There are mentions of ‘chaos’ and ‘madness’ where their houses appear as a source of disorder that can be distanced from. At the centre of these notifications is the exaggerated detachment from their immediate physical environment. Generalizing from these notifications the house is a source of confinement associated with restrictive movement, in the desire for a ‘[…] route out of my house’. The constraint of place is telling in terms of discourses about escape, where the physical presence of the building creates a space to be reacted against. In comparison to the discussions of escape formed around temporality and emotive reflection, the above mentions of escape are divided by the physicality of place. The image that is most apparent is that of the house – note the exclusion of ‘home’ – that grasps at the overarching personal need for escape. Here there is a sense that the notifications and updates in their publicized form allow the authors to vent and live out – as far as is possible – a moment of escape and physical departure from the house. </p>
			<p>It would seem that escape is best understood as a process, a movement or form of projected mobility. The following two updates are particularly apt in drawing these issues together: </p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Escaping reality. Getting high always feels so much better</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">but really, so many shallow kids get drunk or high for no real reason. WHAT ARE YOU ESCAPING FROM?</p>
			<p>Narratives built around the escape of reality and influence of drugs and alcohol provide both a real and imagined escaping. The first is looking to alter the terms of reality in escaping by getting high, and the second generates a different reaction to this condition. The terms of the process of escaping are personal, concerning the building up of particular actions, but they often tap into an engagement with broader issues of morality and citizenship. More generally the relationship between reality and the physical confines of space draw out the escaping process.</p>
			<p>When we review all of these snapshots of escape there remain limits. Where there exists a contrast in these dialogues it is with the assumptions of effortless moments of escape – such as being able to leave the house or enjoy an altered state of being – against barriers to escaping that effects this condition – such as time constraints and perceived relationships or responsibilities. The territoriality of escape perhaps generates the most social complexity, as it seems to offer genuine moments of escape whilst also presenting the most tangible material boundaries. However, there remains an unknown limit to how often such moments can be created and acted upon. This we might speculate is likely to be closely related to the types of opportunities that are generated by social hierarchies and economic capital.</p>
			<p>One reason to pay attention to the overtures of escape and escaping is the observation that our increasingly connected worldviews have created new sets of processes, moments for interaction, skills and limitations – a real-time and visible account of cultural escapism emerges within social media. The indication of a territoriality of escape relates rather subtly to a fixedness that is motivated at an individual level. This is captured in the following notifications: </p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Escaping to my room seems like the only option. I planned on going for a lot of long walks this week, but the weather has put an end to that</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Nothing better than escaping to a loft for a quick read and nap</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">i like to read because it means that for a few hours you can escape into a world that isn’t your own</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Library earlier, got great novel, can hardly put down. Reading more, on internet/surfing less. Nice to escape world turmoil, read a book</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Escaping back to my world of fiction</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Escaping the world for a bit</p>
			<p class="quote_less-space-after">Escaping this world for now</p>
			<p>One reason to escape is an individual desire to be immersed in ‘[…] a new world that isn’t your own’. There is a pattern of engagement with another world. And so their motivation is channeled by an individual ability to experience the sense of a different physical space. There seems to be two main aspects of progression to a state of escape here. One of these involves the recognition of dissatisfaction with the physicality of ‘the world’ and changing nature of escape associated with such limits. Another response is the individual delight at being able to – at will – separate the self and to maintain a new state that is constant for the duration of an escape. For example, one Twitter user delights in ‘Reading more’, which fuels the shared recommendation, ‘[… ] to escape a world of turmoil, read a book’. A reading of Anthony Giddens would suggest that humans have a fundamental need to feel secure and to stabilize themselves in a ‘runaway world’.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-19-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-19">19</a></sup> In one way then forms of escape are used to combat anxieties about the instability of the world that surrounds the individual, or to make a knowing glance towards an awareness of a shared sense of uncertainty and instability. The emerging territoriality of escape provides at least a moment and new space where the individual may feel more settled or secure or where they may find common ground for solidarity to emerge through the inescapability of these territories. </p>
			<p>Across many of the tweets is a sense of escape from the mundane and the type of oppressive power of the repetitive routines talked about by Cohen and Taylor.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-20-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-20">20</a></sup> Indeed, the act of tweeting (itself a routine act of repetition!) may represent an act of escape in itself, the content we have focused upon here may be the by-product of an act of escape on the part of the creator. Indeed as Marwick and boyd have argued, there is something of a ‘context collapse’ where multiple audiences are pulled into single contexts and content reflects the reaction of an imagined reaction.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-21-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-21">21</a></sup> Such collapse also marks a move to the experience of escape as something else that is engaged with someone else – whether a material space, emotion or a moment in time. Indeed, there are hints here that suggest that it is now necessary to signal an escape from Twitter and social media more broadly. For those who manage their sociability and social networks through constant connections and updates, disconnection to reading, for example, requires an explanation. The nature of the speed and ubiquity of social media constitute a new set of social responsibilities and demand a new form of communicative etiquette. We need to reflect upon how the communications of issues of escape are filtered through this etiquette in order to understand more fully what it might reveal.</p>
			<h3 class="text_subtitle">Conclusion<strong></strong></h3>
			<p>This text is not directly about the actual practices and strategies of escape found within everyday life. It might point towards these, but rather it is about the way in which escape is talked about in everyday interaction. The extracts that are mentioned in this article might reveal something of the things that people aim to escape from, how they intend to escape, and where to, but what they actually reveal is a widespread and routine discussion of escape and escaping in social media. Our analysis has revolved around three themes, but these should not be thought of as a separate. Rather, we found a close weaving of time, emotions and space within the content we extracted. From our analysis it is apparent that the sense of a need to <em>get away from things</em> permeates through all the updates, in some greater or lesser form. Escape and escaping become a topic around which people can interact, it represents a shared motif of everyday life that affords resonance between people and represents a way of communicating the presentation of self across social media – whether as a public expression of private frustration or of the need to present the presence of private frustration. To be part of these flows of information is as important as the content of the updates themselves as these become a way of presenting frustration, cynicism, discomfort, and a desire to express a shared sensibility. By communicating this sense of a need to be elsewhere some shared ground is formed upon which people can relate in what is often understood as a fragmented, decentered and individualized cultural setting. The volumes of posts on escape illustrate its embeddedness in everyday discourse and its familiarity as a topic. A longer-term inspection of notifications might reveal that escape is actually an established social media topic, a topic that people turn to in order to stimulate interaction or to create content. Far from being an expression of an individualized culture, this is an expression of shared experience. It is particularly interesting that social media becomes an outlet for talk about escape, it may be seen that the constantly switched on pressures created by such media is the very thing that people might wish to escape from.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-22-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-22">22</a></sup></p>
			<p>The constant notifications that are fuelled by social media may represent a futile and modern method to escape or, as Cohen and Taylor put it, ‘to get through the day’.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-23-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-23">23</a></sup> These gestures can only ever be fleeting and seem doomed to be absorbed, even lost, in the acceleration and flows of content. Forms of dialogue are driven by personal reflections on happiness, anxieties over personal prospects – be this relationships or careers – and uncertainty over the appropriate actions to take. The outcome we have shown here is a prevalent preoccupation with <em>the escape of talking about escaping</em>, matched with the connected sensibility of the self to be in effect ‘always on’.<sup><a id="footnote-302270-24-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-302270-24">24</a></sup> There is an irony that in this context defined by the necessity to be constantly switched-on, people are using media as an outlet for talking about escape. </p>
			<p class="text-last">The work here suggests that the type of dialogues about escape outlined are an important part of everyday interaction that may be used to foster a sense of sameness, of shared frustrations, of inescapability, and finally, of the need to get away. Communicating these sentiments appears to be a routine and prominent part of contemporary interaction. Indeed, communicating the sense of a need to escape might be one way of understanding the fostering of contemporary relations in an individualized and fragmented social media culture. Talk of escape is a sure topic for finding common ground where common ground is hard to find. Similarly we might suggest that talk of escape is indicative of the confinement that appears to define everyday life, escape from which might be a fantasy that is being globally disseminated by the everyday archives that constitute recent developments in media infrastructures. Talking about escape, as one instance of the private becoming public, reveals something to us about the connections that are being made in social media.</p>

The software used provided the storage for the content that was captured and also facilitated the analysis. This then mixes commercial software with critical social science and opens up issues about storage and questions regarding the function of the a priori analytics performed by the software package. All of the data used in this article, by chance, was extracted from Twitter. Twitter content does not appear to be archived for long periods of time. This software package extracted the data in real-time and stored it so as to overcome this problem. The Twitter API can be used to do this, but it does mean that data extraction cannot really be done retrospectively from Twitter. Finally, it posed questions about how to identify the posters of the content. We have decided in this article to simply include the relevant posts without names so as to avoid problems of gendering the content when gender was not always clear in the content. </p>
