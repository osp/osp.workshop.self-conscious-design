During the period of World Wars propaganda has been one of the main tools of controlled </p>

information and the manipulation of public opinion. The content mainly covered militaristic</p>

activities, rasist and atheist or cultist ideologies, education of the youth, freedom of speech and </p>

Especially in Bolschevik Russia, propoganda had developed into an independent form of art, </p>

Europe to serve local regimes. The interesting commonly shared design concept was popular</p>

propoganda symbolism as well as similar color schemes. Even if the represented ideas</p>

Another interesting factor is that in different parts of world, also mainly due to international</p>
