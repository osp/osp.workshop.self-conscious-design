			<div id="theDescription" ><span>Books are stories. But stories are meant to be time and space based. The advantage a book gives to a story is the fact that the Author can not manage the time that someone will spend on a page. This way, a short action can be read at different speeds depending of the reader. But what if we transform the essence of Book giving by it a new dimension? Time is running out now, don't be too slow. But don't think being fast will resolve it. You can not manage the future.</span></div>
